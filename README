In this repository, you will find well-known, fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms, implemented in Python 3.

The goal of these exercises is to implement data structures and algorithms from the ground up, using only basic Python lists, classes and functions.  By refraining from using built-in library functions or data structures, a learning opportunity arises, to understand of the underlying architectures and design of these important algorithms.
